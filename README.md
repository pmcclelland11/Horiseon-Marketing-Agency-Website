# UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp - Module 1 - Challenge
For our Module 1 Challenge assignment, we have been provided with the source code for marketing agency’s website. The goal of this project is to ensure that the webpage functions and displays information properly, while also cleaning up source code in the process (scout rule). Lastly, we must adhere to accessibility standards – both for individuals with disabilities and optimized for search engines.

## User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Installation
No special installation is necessary to view this project.

## Usage 
This project is intended for education purposes only.

## Features
Our first module focused on basic web development with HTML and CSS, as well as getting us familiar with GitHub. This project was intended to test our understanding of concepts we learned in the first week. By reviewing this marketing agency's website, we are testing our ability to review and clean up code, while also getting the opportunity to learn how to optimze webpages and fulfill accessability standards.
